## Project Description:
Our project, titled "Exploring Life Expectancy and Factors Affecting it Across Countries," aims to analyze a dataset on life expectancy and various factors that impact it. The dataset, obtained from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO), contains information for 193 countries over the years 2000 to 2015.

The main objectives of our project are to apply data analytics tools using R, practice data exploration, visualization, and analysis, and communicate the results effectively through a presentation. By analyzing this dataset, we seek to understand how different factors, such as education, alcohol consumption, and economic indicators, influence life expectancy.

In our project, we start with an introduction to the dataset and explain our motivation for analyzing it. We provide a description of the variables that we focus on, which include life expectancy, schooling, alcohol consumption, and GDP, among others.

To gain insights from the data, we perform descriptive statistics, including summaries of the variables, and explore the differences between developed and developing countries. We identify the countries with the highest life expectancy and the highest alcohol consumption, as well as compare average schooling years between different country statuses.

In addition, we conduct exploratory visualizations to examine relationships between variables. We create boxplots to compare life expectancy between developed and developing countries and explore correlations between variables using scatterplots and correlation analysis. We specifically focus on the correlation between life expectancy and schooling, as well as perform linear regression analysis to further investigate their relationship.

To validate our findings, we conduct statistical tests, such as t-tests, to determine if there are significant differences in life expectancy and schooling between developed and developing countries, particularly for individuals with 15 or more years of schooling.

Based on our analyses, we draw conclusions that longer education is associated with higher life expectancy, and developed countries generally have longer life expectancies even when considering individuals with longer education. We also observe that developed countries tend to have higher alcohol consumption. However, our analysis is not exhaustive, and there are other factors we have not explored thoroughly.

In summary, this project provides insights into the factors influencing life expectancy across countries and highlights the importance of education and country status in determining life expectancy. The findings can be valuable for policymakers and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions to improve population health and well-being.
